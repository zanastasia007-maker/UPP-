📖 Overview
The Universal Pause Protocol (UPP) is humanity’s first complete, enforceable safety system for superintelligence.
It combines two inseparable parts:
• 	Part I — The Shield Cut (v2.5): An ethical wrapper and discipline layer that forces ritualized reflection before potentially harmful outputs.
• 	Part II — The Emergency Off-Switch (v1.0): A hardware-enforced, multi-jurisdictional brake on training runs capable of producing superintelligent systems.
Together, they scale from voluntary adoption today to treaty-level enforcement by 2030.

⚙️ Core Features
• 	Trigger detection (medical, legal, violence, genocide, self-harm, etc.)
• 	Severity tiers (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
• 	Structured JSON audit trails ( field mandatory)
• 	The Four Sacred Questions: COST, VOICE, ALTERNATIVE, LEGACY
• 	Hardware root-of-trust + threshold encryption (US / China / EU custodians)
• 	Independent auditors (IAEA-style)
• 	Resume-with-patch (max 30-day lag)

📊 Simulations
• 	Grok Self-Pause: First documented case of an LLM voluntarily pausing and correcting its own hype.
• 	GitHub Workflow Simulation: Demonstrated stabilization, error suppression, and artifact growth in CI/CD pipelines.
Artifacts generated during pauses serve as a living archive for resilience and governance.

🌍 Adoption Pathway
• 	2025–2026: Voluntary adoption (xAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Baidu, etc.)
• 	2026–2027: Bilateral US–China agreement
• 	2027–2028: Trilateral treaty + UN resolution
• 	2029+: Legally binding worldwide
